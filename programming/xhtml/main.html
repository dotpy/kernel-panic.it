<h2>3. XHTML 1.0 element by element</h2>

<p>So far, we have covered the requisites and the overall structure of a XHTML 1.0 document: now let's take a look, one by one, at all the elements that will fill this structure to give a content to the document.</p>
<p>I have chosen the tree structure on the left to represent the full list of XHTML elements: I think this is the simplest and most effective way to visually represent the elements hierarchy of a XHTML document. It is fundamental to always keep in mind this hierarchy; in fact, as we have seen before, the XHTML syntax is much stricter than HTML: you have to pay attention not only to nesting and ending tags, but also to how elements can nest inside each other.</p>
<p>By clicking on any element in the tree, you will be shown a table with the list of all its attributes (except those deprecated by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">Transitional DTD</a>), their value type, their default value (if any) and some short notes on their usage. Mandatory attributes are identified by an exclamation mark (<img src="icons/mandatory.png" alt="!" />).</p>
<p>Clicking on &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot;, instead, will expand/collapse a tree node to show which elements it can contain. Of course, such a tree could branch endlessly, for instance, because of recursive nesting. Therefore, to prevent messages like the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="icons/crash.jpg" alt="crash" width="623" height="139" /></p>
<p>from popping up, I decided to keep the tree depth at a reasonable level; after all, it should be clear that, for instance, an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) within the <code>body</code> element can contain the very same elements as an unordered list within a <code>form</code> <span style="font-size: 85%;">within a <code>div</code></span> <span style="font-size: 70%;">within a table cell</span> <span style="font-size: 55%;">within...</span></p>
