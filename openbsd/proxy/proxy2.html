<h2>2. Squid</h2>

<p>Squid is <q>a fully-featured HTTP/1.0 proxy</q> and it <q>offers a rich access control, authorization and logging environment to develop web proxy and content serving applications</q>.</p>

<h3><a id="proxy-2.1" name="proxy-2.1"></a>2.1 Installation</h3>

<p>Let's start with the location of the cache server in the network: according to the <a href="http://www.deckle.co.za/squid-users-guide/Squid_Configuration_Basics#DMZ">documentation</a>, the most suitable place is in the <acronym title="DeMilitarized Zone">DMZ</acronym>; this should keep the cache server secure while still able to peer with other, outside, caches (such as the ISP's).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.deckle.co.za/squid-users-guide/Squid_Configuration_Basics#Setting_Squid.27s_HTTP_Port">documentation</a> also recommends setting a DNS name for the cache server (such as &quot;<tt>cache.mydomain.tld</tt>&quot; or &quot;<tt>proxy.mydomain.tld</tt>&quot;) as soon as possible: <q>a simple DNS entry can save many hours further down the line. Configuring client machines to access the cache server by IP address is asking for a long, painful transition down the road</q>.</p>
<p>Squid installation is as simple as it can be; you only have to add the Squid package. Available flavors are &quot;ldap&quot; (allowing for <acronym title="Lightweight Directory Access Protocol">LDAP</acronym> authentication) and &quot;snmp&quot; (including <a href="#proxy-2.7">SNMP</a> support).</p>

The local (OpenBSD) differences are:
configuration files are in              /etc/squid
sample configuration files are in       /usr/local/share/examples/squid
error message files are in              /usr/local/share/squid/errors
sample error message files are in       /usr/local/share/examples/squid/errors
icons are in                            /usr/local/share/squid/icons
sample icons are in                     /usr/local/share/examples/squid/icons
the cache is in                         /var/squid/cache
logs are stored in                      /var/squid/logs
the ugid squid runs as is               _squid:_squid

Please remember to initialize the cache by running &quot;squid -z&quot; before
trying to run Squid for the first time.

You can also edit /etc/rc.local so that Squid is started automatically:

    if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/squid ]; then
        echo -n ' squid';       /usr/local/sbin/squid
    fi

<h3><a id="proxy-2.2" name="proxy-2.2"></a>2.2 Base configuration</h3>

<p>Squid configuration relies on several dozens of parameters, and thus can quickly turn into a very tricky task. Therefore, the best approach is probably starting with a very basic configuration and then tweaking the options, one by one, to meet your specific needs, while still making sure that everything keeps working as expected.</p>
<p>Actually, only a few parameters need to be set to get Squid up and running (theoretically, you could even run Squid with an empty configuration file): for all the options you don't explicitly set, the default values are assumed. Anyway, at least one setting must certainly be changed: the default configuration file denies access to all browsers; and this may sound a bit ...too strict!</p>
<p>Our first configuration will be very simple: we will place our proxy server in the DMZ (172.16.240.0/24, <a href="../carp/carp2.html#net">this</a> is the network layout) and allow only requests from the LAN (172.16.0.0/24). No ISP's parent proxy is taken into account.</p>
<p>The main Squid configuration file is <tt>/etc/squid/squid.conf</tt>. Let's have a look at it.</p>
<p>The <tt>http_port</tt> option sets the port(s) that Squid will listen on for incoming HTTP requests. There are three forms: port alone (e.g. &quot;<tt>http_port 3128</tt>&quot;), hostname with port (e.g. &quot;<tt>http_port proxy.kernel-panic.it:3128</tt>&quot;), and IP address with port (e.g. &quot;<tt>http_port 172.16.240.151:3128</tt>&quot;); you can specify multiple socket addresses, each on a separate line. If your Squid machine is multi-homed and directly accessible from the internet, it is strongly recommended that you force Squid to bind the socket to the internal address. This way, Squid will only be visible from the internal network and won't proxy the whole world! Squid's default HTTP port is 3128, but many administrators prefer using a port which is easier to remember, such as 8080.</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
http_port   3128
</pre>
</div>

<p>The <tt>cache_dir</tt> parameter allows you to specify the path, size and depth of the directories where the cache swap files will be stored. Squid allows you to have multiple <tt>cache_dir</tt> tags in your config file.</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
cache_dir   ufs /var/squid/cache 100 16 256
</pre>
</div>

<p>The above line sets the cache directory pathname to <tt>/var/squid/cache</tt>, with a size of 100MB and 16 <dfn>first-level</dfn> subdirectories, each containing 256 <dfn>second-level</dfn> subdirectories. The cache directory must exist and be writable by the Squid process and its size can't exceed 80% of the whole disk. For further details, please refer to the <a href="http://www.deckle.co.za/squid-users-guide/Squid_Configuration_Basics#Where_to_Store_Cached_Data">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The <tt>cache_mgr</tt> parameter contains the e-mail address of the Squid administrator, which will appear at the end of the error pages; e.g.:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
cache_mgr   webmaster@kernel-panic.it
</pre>
</div>

<p>The <tt>cache_effective_user</tt> and <tt>cache_effective_group</tt> options, allow you to set the UID and GID Squid will drop its privileges to once it has bound to the incoming network port. The package installation has already created the <tt>_squid</tt> user and group.</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
cache_effective_user    _squid
cache_effective_group   _squid
</pre>
</div>

<p>The <tt>ftp_user</tt> option sets the e-mail address that Squid will use as the password for anonymous FTP login. It's a good practice to use an existing address:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
ftp_user    webmaster@kernel-panic.it
</pre>
</div>

<p>The following options set the paths to the log files; the format of the access log file, which logs every request received by the cache, can be specified by using a <tt>logformat</tt> directive (please refer to the <a href="http://devel.squid-cache.org/customlog/logformat.html">documentation</a> for a detailed list of the available format codes):</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
<i># Define the access log format</i>
logformat squid  %ts.%03tu %6tr %&gt;a %Ss/%03Hs %&lt;st %rm %ru %un %Sh/%&lt;A %mt
<i># Log client request activities ('squid' is the name of the log format to use)</i>
access_log       /var/squid/logs/access.log squid

<i># Log information about the cache's behavior</i>
cache_log        /var/squid/logs/cache.log
<i># Log the activities of the storage manager</i>
cache_store_log  /var/squid/logs/store.log
</pre>
</div>

<p>And now we come to one of the most tricky parts of the configuration: Access Control Lists. The simplest way to restrict access is to only accept requests from the internal network. Such a basic access control can be enough in small networks, especially if you don't wish to use features like username/password authentication or URL filtering.</p>
<p>ACLs are usually split into two parts: <dfn>acl lines</dfn>, starting with the <tt>acl</tt> keyword and defining <dfn>classes</dfn>, and <dfn>acl operators</dfn>, allowing or denying requests based on classes. Acl-operators are checked from top to bottom and the first matching wins. Below is a very basic ruleset:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
<i># Classes</i>
acl  all           src    all               <i># Any IP address</i>
acl  localhost     src    127.0.0.0/8       <i># Localhost</i>
acl  lan           src    172.16.0.0/24     <i># LAN where authorized clients reside</i>
acl  manager       proto  cache_object      <i># Cache object protocol</i>
acl  to_localhost  dst    127.0.0.0/8       <i># Requests to localhost</i>
acl  SSL_ports     port   443               <i># https port</i>
acl  Safe_ports    port   80 21 443         <i># http, ftp, https ports</i>
acl  CONNECT       method CONNECT           <i># SSL CONNECT method</i>

<i># Only allow cachemgr access from localhost</i>
http_access  allow  manager localhost
http_access  deny   manager

<i># Deny requests to unknown ports</i>
http_access  deny   !Safe_ports

<i># Deny CONNECT to other than SSL ports</i>
http_access  deny   CONNECT !SSL_ports

<i># Prevent access to local web applications from remote users</i>
http_access  deny   to_localhost

<i># Allow access from the local network</i>
http_access  allow  lan

<i># Default deny (this must be the last rule)</i>
http_access  deny   all

<h3><a id="proxy-2.3" name="proxy-2.3"></a>2.3 Starting Squid</h3>

<p>Now our cache server is almost ready for a first run, just one last step to go. We first need to create the cache-swap directories where Squid will store cached pages. The &quot;<tt>squid -z</tt>&quot; command will create all the required directories, according to the <tt>cache_dir</tt> parameter in <tt>squid.conf</tt> (see <a href="#proxy-2.2">above</a>), as the user and group specified by the <tt>cache_effective_user</tt> and <tt>cache_effective_group</tt> parameters.</p>

<p>We are now ready to start Squid. Starting it in debug mode (<tt>-d 1</tt> flag) and in foreground (<tt>-N</tt> flag) will make it easier to see if everything is working fine.</p>

<p>Once you get the &quot;<tt>Ready to serve requests</tt>&quot; message, you should be able to use the cache server. Once it is up and running, Squid reads the cache store: the first time you should see all zeros, as above, because the cache store is empty.</p>
<p>Now, to make sure everything is working fine, we will configure our browser to use our fresh new proxy and we will try to access our favourite web site. In the <tt>/var/squid/logs/access.log</tt> file, you should see something like:</p>

<div class="code">
  <div>/var/squid/logs/access.log</div>
<pre>
1242419601.435   6735 172.16.0.13 TCP_MISS/200 11810 GET http://www.kernel-panic.it/ - DIRECT/62.149.140.23 text/html
1242419849.536     14 172.16.0.13 TCP_HIT/200 11820 GET http://www.kernel-panic.it/ - NONE/- text/html
[...]
</pre>
</div>

<p>For a detailed description of each field in the <tt>access.log</tt> file, please refer to the <a href="http://www.deckle.co.za/squid-users-guide/Starting_Squid#Access.log_basics">documentation</a>. Anyway, <tt>TCP_MISS</tt> means that the requested page wasn't stored in the cache (either it was not present or it had expired); <tt>TCP_HIT</tt>, instead, means that the page was served from the cache. The second field is the time (in milliseconds) that Squid took to service the request: as you can see, it is much shorter when the page is cached. The page size is the fifth field: cached pages may be a little larger because of the extra headers added by Squid.</p>
<p>If everything is working fine, we can stop Squid:</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
# <kbd>/usr/local/sbin/squid -k shutdown</kbd>
</pre>
</div>

<p>and configure the system to start it on boot.</p>

<div class="code">
  <div>/etc/rc.local</div>
<pre>
if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/squid ]; then
    echo -n ' squid'
    /usr/local/sbin/squid
fi
</pre>
</div>

<p>You may also wish to start Squid through the <tt>RunCache</tt> script, which automatically restarts it on failure and logs both to the <tt>/var/squid/squid.out</tt> file and to syslog. Just remember to background it with an &quot;<tt>&amp;</tt>&quot;, or it will hang the system at boot time.</p>
